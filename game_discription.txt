					             Game

1.	I use circular linked list for implementing this game. List contain name field to store name of kid.
2.	In main flag is use for allow to enter kid name only once in case 1.
3.	In case 2 use random function of stdlib.h header file that generate random number form 0 to M-1 then pass this N to function Eliminate().
4.	Case 3 use for show position of kids.
5.	Function adddetail() simply create circular linked list.
6.	Function show() assign position to every kid starting form first node of circular linked list.
7.	Function Eliminate() use two node pointer prev and temp ,prev use for keep trak of predecessor of temp node and temp is use for traverse in list from 1 to N  to find kid to eliminate.
In this function prev first set to last node of list and it use for eliminate first nade in list
i.e.         position                name
	1		bhavin	
	2		ashish
	3		bhargav

Then prev fist set to bhargav and if N=1
Than it will not going to while(i!=no) and eliminate first node and set N+1 node to first.
