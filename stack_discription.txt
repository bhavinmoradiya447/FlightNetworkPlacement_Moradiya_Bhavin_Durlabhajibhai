1.	 Define structure that contains tow member number and structure pointer of that structure node.
2.	first represent starting node of linked list , newnode used for create new node,temp used for temporary node.
3.	top used to handle correct sequence of push operation and it is top of stack.
    In main function flag is used for assign  starting value to a  top variable
    i.e. in case 1 of switch statement  if flag==0  and number is push as 5 6 7 8 9
    Than it set top=5 first and then it check for correct sequence in next “else if”. 
4.	In case 2 pop value from stack and put it into temporary array for printing pattern.
5.	In function push() , create linked list and every time put new node to end of list.
6.	In function pop(), every time it pop value from end of list. It also check  condition for empty list and return poped  value. If poped value is 9 than it set top to -1 because next push operation must be start with 0.
